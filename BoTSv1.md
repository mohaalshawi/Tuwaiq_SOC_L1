# Web Defacement attack scenario 

## What content management system is imreallynotbatman.com likely using? (Please do not include punctuation such as . , ! ? in your answer. We are looking for alpha characters only.)

## What is the likely IP address of someone from the Po1s0n1vy group scanning imreallynotbatman.com for web application vulnerabilities?

## What company created the web vulnerability scanner used by Po1s0n1vy? Type the company name. (For example, "Microsoft" or "Oracle")

## What IP address is likely attempting a brute force password attack against imreallynotbatman.com?

## What was the first brute force password used?

## What is the name of the executable uploaded by Po1s0n1vy? Please include the file extension. (For example, "notepad.exe" or "favicon.ico")

## What is the MD5 hash of the executable uploaded?

## What was the correct password for admin access to the content management system running "imreallynotbatman.com"?

## What is the name of the file that defaced the imreallynotbatman.com website? Please submit only the name of the file with the extension (For example, "notepad.exe" or "favicon.ico").

## This attack used dynamic DNS to resolve to the malicious IP. What is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) associated with this attack?

## What IP address has Po1s0n1vy tied to domains that are pre-staged to attack Wayne Enterprises?

##Based on the data gathered from this attack and common open-source intelligence sources for domain names, what is the email address most likely associated with the Po1s0n1vy APT group?

## GCPD reported that common TTP (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) for the Po1s0n1vy APT group, if initial compromise fails, is to send a spear-phishing email with custom malware attached to their intended target. This malware is usually connected to Po1s0n1vy's initial attack infrastructure. Using research techniques, provide the SHA256 hash of this malware.

## What is the special hex code associated with the customized malware discussed in the previous question? (Hint: It's not in Splunk)

## One of Po1s0n1vy's staged domains has some disjointed "unique" whois information. Concatenate the two codes together and submit them as a single answer.

## One of the passwords in the brute force attack is James Brodsky's favorite Coldplay song. Hint: we are looking for a six-character word on this one. Which is it?

## What was the average password length used in the password brute-forcing attempt? (Round to a closest whole integer. For example "5" not "5.23213")

## How many seconds elapsed between the brute force password scan identified the correct password and the compromised login? Round to 2 decimal places.

## How many unique passwords were attempted in the brute force attempt?
